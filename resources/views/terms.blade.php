                    <h5>Travel bookings</h5>
                    <p>Additional terms and conditions will apply to your reservation and purchase of travel-related
                        goods and services that you select. Please read these additional terms and conditions carefully.
                        In particular, if you have purchased an
                        airfare, please ensure you read the full terms and conditions of carriage issued by the travel
                        supplier, which can be found on the supplier’s website. You agree to abide by the terms and
                        conditions of purchase imposed by any supplier
                        with whom you elect to deal, including, but not limited to, payment of all amounts when due and
                        compliance with the supplier’s rules and restrictions regarding availability and use of fares,
                        products, or services. Airfare is only
                        guaranteed only the purchase has been completed and the tickets have been issued. Airlines and
                        other travel suppliers may change their prices without notice. We reserve the right to cancel
                        your booking if full payment is not received
                        in a timely fashion. You are responsible for ensuring that you meet foreign entry requirements
                        and that your travel documents, such as passports and visas are in order and other foreign entry
                        requirements are met. We urge customers
                        to review travel prohibitions, warnings, announcements, and advisories issued by the relevant
                        governments before booking travel to international destinations. You must consult the relevant
                        embassy or consulate for passport and
                        visa requirements for your destination. We accept no liability if you are refused entry onto a
                        flight or into a country due to your failure to carry the correct and adequate passport, visa,
                        or other travel documents required. Recommended
                        inoculations for travel may change and you should consult your doctor for current
                        recommendations before you depart. It is your responsibility to ensure that you meet all health
                        entry requirements, obtain the recommended inoculations,
                        take all recommended medication, and follow all medical advice about your trip.
                    </p>
                    <p>BY OFFERING RESERVATIONS FOR TRAVEL IN PARTICULAR DESTINATIONS, WE DO NOT WARRANT OR REPRESENT
                        THAT TRAVEL TO SUCH AREAS IS ADVISABLE OR WITHOUT RISK AND WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR DAMAGES OR
                        LOSSES THAT MAY RESULT FROM TRAVEL TO SUCH DESTINATIONS.</p>
                    <p>Federal law forbids the carriage of hazardous materials aboard aircraft in your luggage or on
                        your person. A violation can result in five years imprisonment and penalties of $250,000 or more
                        (49 U.S.C. 5124). Hazardous materials include
                        explosives, compressed gases, flammable liquids and solids, oxidizers, poisons, corrosives, and
                        radioactive materials. </p>

                    <p>
                        Your payment is processed in the United States when we process your payment. When the travel
                        supplier processes your payment, it will be processed in the country in which the travel
                        supplier is based. Either we or the travel supplier may have to verify:
                        (1) the validity of the payment card (through the charge of a nominal value that is either
                        refunded within a few days or deducted from the final payment due to the travel supplier) and
                        (2) the availability of funds on the payment
                        card (to be confirmed by the bank issuing your credit card).
                    </p>
                    <p>Some banks and credit card companies impose fees for international or cross-border transactions.
                        Furthermore, booking international travel may be considered an international transaction by your
                        bank or card company, since we may pass
                        your card details to an international travel supplier to be charged. Also, some banks and card
                        companies impose fees for currency conversion. The currency exchange rate and the foreign
                        transaction fee are determined solely by your
                        bank on the day that they process the transaction. If you have any questions about these fees or
                        the exchange rate applied to your booking, please contact your bank.</p>
