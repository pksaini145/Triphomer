                    <h5>Agreement between customer and Trip Homer</h5>

                    <p>This Website is provided solely to assist customers in gathering travel information, determining
                        the availability of travel-related goods and services, making legitimate reservations, or
                        otherwise transacting business with travel suppliers,
                        and for no other purposes. The terms "we", "us", "our", “Trip Homer” and "Trip Homer, Inc."
                        refer to Trip Homer, Inc., a California corporation. The term "you" refers to the customer
                        visiting the Website and/or booking a reservation
                        through us on this Website, or through our customer service agents.</p>

                    <h5>Refund timelines, policies & process</h5>

                    <p>Due to COVID-19, most refunds for flights, including when they’re part of a package, are issued
                        within 12 weeks. Some refunds could take a bit longer, depending on the airline.</p>

                    <p>Refunds for hotel, car, or activity, including when they’re part of a package, are processed
                        within our normal timeframe, 24 hours from the cancellation request. Keep in mind, your bank or
                        payment service determines when the funds
                        become available in your account.</p>

                    <p>In other circumstances not impacted by COVID-19, here’s what you should know about refund
                        timelines:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            ● Trip Homer may take up to 24 hours to process your refund. Once that has happened, your
                            bank or payment service (such as PayPal) will take care of the rest. Just know that it may
                            take them up to 7 days to post the credit to your account, and up to 2
                            billing cycles to show the credit on your statement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ● You’ll see the refund on your original method(s) of payment. So, say you paid using your
                            debit card -- that’s where the money will be refunded. We’ll send you an email with the
                            nitty-gritty about your refund amount, and how and when you'll get it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ● If your credit card statement includes a charge from a third party (such as a low-cost
                            airline, rental car company, or cruise line), you’ll receive your refund from them, not Trip
                            Homer. If this is the case, get in touch with that third party to ask
                            any questions about refunds.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            ● If you've been charged a deposit or partial payment, you'll be refunded for that amount,
                            minus any fees. Say you paid a USD 200 deposit on your hotel, but you ended up having to
                            cancel. If the hotel charges a USD 20 cancellation fee, you’d get USD 180
                            back.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
