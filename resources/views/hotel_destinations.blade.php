                    Fremont Street</h4>
                <p>In the old downtown of Las Vegas, another vibrant street called the Fremont Street comes to life
                    after sunset. A small section of the street covered with a canopy of LED lights illuminates the sky.
                    Several street performances and entertainers can also be enjoyed on the street. Fremont Street is
                    located just off the Strip.</p>

                <h4>The Strip</h4>

                <p>
                    The Strip, also known as Las Vegas Boulevard, draws millions of tourists to this city. When the sun
                    is out, the street is known for its shopping mall, theaters, and restaurant, but once the Sun goes
                    down the area turns into an even livelier place. Giant LEDs and neon signs help the visitors decide
                    their venues where unlimited entertainment awaits them.</p>
